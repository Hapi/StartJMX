README - startjmx
-----------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------
'startjmx' is a small utility to start a JMX agent of the target JVM without restarting it.

NOTICE! This works only on Java 1.6 or later.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Java 1.6 or later

Be aware that a dependency to Sun's tools.jar is a system dependency and thus needs to be set
accordingly if you are to compile this utility from the source. In Sun's reference implementation
(1.6) this artifact is called tools.jar but, for example, on Mac OSX 10.6 needed classes are in
classes.jar.

Also, when running the utility the same artifact must be found from the class path, of course.
